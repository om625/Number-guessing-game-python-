# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where you guess a random number between two numbers you choose. Built after just 8 days of learning Python as my first coding project!

## Features
- Enter two numbers to set the range.
- Get 10 chances to guess the correct number.
- Fun emoji feedback for guesses (thumbs up/down, party face, etc.).
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Install the `emoji` library by running `pip install emoji` in your terminal.
3. Download the `number_guessing_game.py` file.
4. Run it with `python number_guessing_game.py` in your terminal or IDE.

## What I Learned
- Using `random.randint()` to generate random numbers.
- Loops (`while`) and conditionals (`if-else`) in Python.
- Handling errors with `try-except`.
- Adding a replay feature (with some AI help to debug it!).

## Notes
- This is my first ever project, built at 17 after finishing my 12th exams.
- I got stuck on the "play again" loop and used AI to fix itâ€”learned a lot in the process!
- Feedback welcome as I keep learning Python.

## Future Ideas
- Add a score system.
- Make it guess my number instead.
- Improve input validation for "yes/no".
